## SceneJS

An extensible WebGL-based engine for high-detail 3D visualisation.

### No longer maintained!

We now use a private and heavily-modified fork of this SceneJS in the [BioDigital Human](http://biodigitalhuman.com). This repository is no longer being maintained, however we'll keep it around because it still works, and may still provide a useful resource for people learning WebGL and developing their own WebGL-based engines.

If you're looking for a production-ready WebGL engine for your visualization applications, try [xeogl](http://xeogl.org), which is based off lessons learned from SceneJS.

### Building

 With [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) installed, build the snapshot binaries with:

 ````grunt snapshot````

 The snapshot binaries are in ````api/latest```` and are used by the examples.
